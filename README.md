SAGA MOVIE POSTER

## Description
duration: 18 hours.
I had to expand on a movie management application. I added features using saga and react, postgresql,and postico.
there were three tables and I used many to many method to match up all the movies to its corresponding genres. Once a user visits
the page, they are able to see movie posters and their names.Once a user clicks on the poster, they are taking to another page which shows
the movie title,description, and all the genres it belongs to.
